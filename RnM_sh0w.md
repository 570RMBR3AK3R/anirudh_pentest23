# Challenge description
- The challenge has three flags to submit, the ssh credentials are given username -admin password -admin

# Approach
- Upon logging in to the system , we find a user.txt , which hints us to examine the shadow file
- Upon inspecting the file , we find that the Rick user and the admin user share the same password hash , ie same password
- Upon logging in as Rick user we get the first flag and also a clue to examine the local database
- Flag = p3nt35t{Th3_w1z4rd5_dung30n}
- When logging in the mysql server, we find a database named dbrick which contains a table called users ( command = mysql -u Rick -h localhost -padmin)
- We find the user Morty's login password in the table
- After logging in we find the second flag in user.txt
- Flag = p3nt35t{Y0u_g0t_th3_su_pr1v1l4g3_4cc3ss}
- The second flag gives a hint that Morty can run as super user , ie sudo
- Therefore by using sudo su we are able to login as root user and retrieve the third flag in root.txt
- Flag = p3nt35t{y0u_tr4c3d_1t}
