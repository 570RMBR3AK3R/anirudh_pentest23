# Challenge Description
- The challenge expects the user to use pwntools to obtain the flag

# Approach
•	There are three stages in this challenge. In the first stage ,the challenger is provided with multiple encodings of different format (binary , hex , base64  ,ASCII) 
  which they have to decode and submit
•	In the second stage the challenger is provided with Caesar ciphers with various shift which they have to decode
•	In the third stage the challenger has to generate random 3 letter word whose hash (the hash could be sha1sum , sha512sum , md5sum , sha256sum) is equivalent to the 
  hash the challenge has provided
•	There is a surprise fourth stage where the challenger has to return all the strings they have returned previously as one string that has been concatenated and hashed 
  with the hashing algorithm the challenge has asked us to.
•	This returns the flag
•	Flag = p3nt35t{00f_tH4t5_t00_mUch_0f_c0d1nG_p1m02923e0j}
