# Challenge Description
- The challenge description provides the ssh username and password (admin , admin)

# Approach
- The hint for the challenge is "Wherever you go it follows", which refers to shadow ie the shadow file
-	Upon inspecting, we find a poorly configured shadow file that gives the user read and write privileges over it
-	The hash of the admin user is over written over the hash of the root user
-	Flag is obtained from the /root/root.txt
-	Flag = p3nt35t{y3s_th4t_1s_sh4d0w}
