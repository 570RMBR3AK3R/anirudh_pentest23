# Challenge Description
- The challenge asks the attacker to uncover the hidden strings within the given apk ie the flag

# Approach
- The files are extracted from the apk using apktools
- This creates a folder called challenge , which stores all the extracted files and folders
- A 'cat * | grep -wR 'p3nt35t' is ran in the challenge folder which reads the whole world -w (ie all folders) recursively -R for the string 'p3nt35t'
- The stdout returns that a matching binary is found in lib/armeabi-v7a/libfindme.so file
- Upon using strings upon the file we find the flag hidden in it
- Flag = p3nt35t{y0u_f0uNd_$tr!ng5.xm1_f!13}
